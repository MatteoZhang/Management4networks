the model is a queue
but the methodology is the FES
and it's a fifo method
infinite queue but FES only see two of the event 
one is the arrival and an other is departure
FES is a priority queue modeled as a tree
highest priority on the top of the tree
if we get the first element then we sort again
use an iterative algorithm for avg
